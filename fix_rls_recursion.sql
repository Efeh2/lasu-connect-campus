-- Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Drop all existing policies on profiles table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow trigger to insert profiles" ON profiles;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow public access for now to fix the recursion issue
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to profiles" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (true);
